### Typing Persian numbers while writing

The windows operating systems do not support Persian numbers and numbers are entered in English. In fact, no operating system supports Persian numbers and they are not considered as numbers; but programmers can easily convert them to real numeral characters (English numbers). The purpose of writing this program is to allow typing Persian numbers by replacing their Unicode character codes with English numbers. All the user needs to do is to run the program. While the program is running, the numbers will automatically change from English to Persian.


### Automatic enable or disable according to each window's keyboard layout

One of the major abilities of this program which has made it user friendly, is that the program automatically detects the keyboard layout and decides whether English numbers should be replaced with Persian numbers or not. If the keyboard layout has been set to Persian, the program would convert the numbers to Persian Unicode characters. For example, the user can type Persian in an internet browser and have the English numbers replaced with Persian ones; while he/she might switch to another application and start typing in English without having to change a setting or closing the program.


### Defining custom hotkey

User can choose a shortcut key to disable or enable the program faster than ever. There are lots of different combinations allowed and user can choose his/her favorite hotkey among them. The first time user runs the program, the settings window will automatically show up and will ask to choose a hotkey. Moreover, user will always be able to change the hotkey if needed.


### Displaying an icon in the system tray

By minimizing the program or clicking the X button on top of the window, the program will hide and a system tray icon will be displayed instead. All of the features of the program are accessible from the tray icon by just right clicking on the icon which results in opening the context menu. The program can be restored by clicking on the icon either by left clicking or right clicking on it and choosing "Restore". The program will be closed with the Exit button on the programs main window or from the context menu.


### Inserting the Zero-width non-joiner (half-space) using Shift + Space


### Running the program on the system start-up (fixed)


### Portable Persian layout

When the user runs the program for the first time, the settings dialog will be automatically shown and the user must choose a shortcut key to enable and disable the program's functionality. If the Persian language isn't installed on the computer, the user will be able to check "Simulate Persian Keyboard" to enable Persian keyboard. To switch between Persian and the original layout, the chosen hotkey may be used.
